# Bluetooth Low Energy jammer with 3D-printed case in usage with Arduino Nano Every
BLE (Bluetooth low energy) jammer using nRF24L01+ modules and an Arduino Nano Every combined in a 3D printed case.

## Brief overview
This repository is based on the original by @lws803 ,but provides a handy 3D case to house all the electronics and migrate the code (detailed commented) to the Arduino Nano Every.
## Project components
1. 1x Arduino Nano Every or Arduino Nano
2. 3x nRF24L01+ modules
3. 1x Mini-Breadboard
